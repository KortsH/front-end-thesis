However, social media posts can be edited or deleted, and quotes misrepresented. Screenshots can be faked, but cryptographic commitments on a blockchain cannot.",

    "what_1": "Use the Quote Verifier demo to test quote authenticity from embedded tweets, Twitter itself, or even raw text.",

    "what_3": "Search our public database of captured social media posts with verifiable timestamps.",
    "how_title": "üîó How it works (in brief)",
    "how_1": "Our system captures tweets from tracked accounts, hashes the content using SHA-256, groups them into Merkle trees, and commits the root on a permissioned blockchain.",
    "how_2": "When you verify a quote, the system checks whether it matches a committed post, either exactly or semantically, and returns a verifiable result in real time.",
